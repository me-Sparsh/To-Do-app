# To-Do Application

This is a simple To-Do application built with ReactJS, Redux, and Bootstrap 5. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. Tasks are persisted using local storage, so they are not lost on page reload.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   
  cd to-do-app

2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

  "npm install"
  or
  "yarn install"

3. Running the Application:
   
To start the development server and run the application, use the following command:

   "npm install react-scripts --save"
   
   then,
  "npm start"
  or
  "yarn start"
  
  This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

4. Usage:
   
  a. To add a new task, enter the task description in the input field and press Enter or click the "Add Task" button.<br>
  b. To view all tasks, click on the "View Tasks" button in the navigation bar.<br>
  c. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.<br>
  d. To mark a task as completed, click the "Done" button next to the task (if available).<br>
  
5. Persistent Storage:
   
  Tasks are saved to local storage, so they will persist even if you reload the page or close the browser.
